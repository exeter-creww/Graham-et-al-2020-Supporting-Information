##### Modelling Eurasian beaver foraging habitat and dam suitability, for predicting the location and number of dams throughout catchments in Great Britain.

Code to Run the BHI and BDC models can be found in SI8. Code for evaluating model performance is presented in SI9. 

To request the data to run BHI and BDC model please contact the Corresponding Author (Hugh Graham - hg340@exeter.ac.uk).
Full output datesets are not provided in this repo or elsewhere due to license requirements.
The exact locations of dams (i.e. point vector data) is also not provided) due to the need to maintain landowner privacy.
On reasonable request, we are willing to share this data.

## Note:
### This Repo will remain as is, providing the original source code and supporting info for the published manuscript. To see more up to date code and info on this project please see - https://github.com/h-a-graham/BDC_V1.2 for a development version of the code.
